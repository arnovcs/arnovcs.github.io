    <p><b>IMAGE:</b> Unfortunately, when using adobe to obtain the color pallete from the picture, 
        the picture itself was not saved, however the color pallete is displayed on this website. 
        The picture I used in for this pallete was a picture of Neel, and the trees behind him. 
    </p>
    <p>The color scheme represents one with different shades of brown. 
        I would say that is reflects colors of the earth, and may convey
        a proffessional or calming tone. It could be described as monochromatic
        due to it only being different shades of brown.
